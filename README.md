# Be the Hero

Plataform created in the OmniStack Week given by       [RocketSeat](https://github.com/Rocketseat).  In this week we learned    about React, React Native and Node.js, with this stack we developed      an really simple plataform to non-governamental organizations (NGO).     Im this applicantion you can create a new profile, generating for you    a ID number, with that ID number you can access your profile, inside     the profile you can create and delete the cases of the organization.

This project was not deployed. I will provide some gif's that will allow you to realize the way that can work.
